# PepTalkGenerator
A quick and easy pep talk generator I created when I saw it on Reddit.

It's a CLI program that grabs strings from four different files and pieces them together to form amusing sentences meant to inspire.

TO USE: Build and run. Read pep talk. Not motivated? Press "Y" and enter. Else, press enter to exit.
