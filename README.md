# PepTalkGenerator
A quick and easy pep talk generator I created when I saw it on Reddit.

It's a CLI program that grabs strings from four different files and pieces them together to form amusing sentences meant to inspire.

TO USE: Build and run. Press 1 to generate pep talk. Not motivated? Generate another!
You can now change the path to the pep talk folders, allowing you to generate any random sentence (assuming you have the files to do it).
Because I think it's funny, I included the necessary files to generate "trash talk," but you could throw something together to make it say anything. Just make sure to split it into four .txt files.
